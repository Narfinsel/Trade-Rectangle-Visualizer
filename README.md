# Trade-Rectangle-Visualizer
Trade-Rectangle Visualizer is a utility class that helps algorithmic traders get a general idea about how well their EA is doing, just by having a quick glance at your chart, without the need to dig through trading logs and reports.

## 1. Introduction
**Why did I start this project?** As an online Fx & stocks trader, I often automatize my strategies - off-loading the hard work to trading bots. But when I want to monitor my bots and get a quick glance at how well they are performing, things become more complicated. There is no easy way to view the profitability of EA bots, other than spending a few minutes inside the EA reports, graphs, and results.

**Why is this a problem?** When it comes to automated trading, the main thing you want to know is how profitable your strategy / Expert Advisor (EA) are. How many recent wins and loses did it record. But this information is burried inside tester sub-windows (reports, results, graphs). If you have dozens of bots running simultanously, going into each of them is time-consuming, frustrating, and non-user friendly.

**How does my script make your life easier?** Instead of digging through countless tabs and sub-windows on dozens of charts, my script draws coloured rectangles and lines displaying profitable trades and loses directly on the graph. Just switch between your instrument charts to see the recents profits, loses, trading statistics.
